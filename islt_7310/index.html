            <p class="Para3">My name is Emily Sheeley and I am a 2nd grade teacher in a local school district in southwest Missouri. I have completed my Master’s degree in Library Science and would eventually love to do something in a library, but for now I am happy to continue in the classroom! Before moving into the classroom, I was an Instructional Technologist, which meant I taught computers to students, but also helped teachers with technology. I have always loved learning about technology and how it can be used in the classroom, so I am pursuing a degree to learn more about that. In my personal time, I love spending time with friends and family, spending time outdoors, traveling, and doing craft projects. I enjoy volunteering with STEAM Club at school as well as at my church. Also, I LOVE reading, so you will probably always find me reading something!</p>
