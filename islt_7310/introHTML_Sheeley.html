Hello! My name is Emily Sheeley and I live in Springfield, Missouri and I am a 2nd grade teacher for Springfield Public Schools. I have my Master’s degree in Library Science and would eventually love to do something in a library, but for now I am happy to continue in the classroom! This year, I decided I would work toward my Education Specialist degree, so this is my first semester back. In my personal time, I love spending time with friends and family, spending time outdoors, doing craft projects, and I LOVE reading, so you will probably always find me reading something! 

I have no previous experience with web development, so I am curious to learn some basics about building a website. I hope to use this to help me build a portfolio for our final program requirement, but I’m also just excited to learn more about the topic!
