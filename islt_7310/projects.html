                <p>I am working toward an Education Specialist degree with an emphasis in Technology in Schools, so by the end of the degree program I will be expected to show mastery in the International Society for Technology in Education’s (ISTE) standards for educators. The standards are as listed below.

                    <div class="row">

                            <h3>Analyst</h3>
                            <p class="a">I had the opportunity to be a Blended Learning Mentor for one year in my school district, and during that time I was able to explore new technologies and implement a couple of those in my classroom. For my first project, I used a program called Actively Learn. This is an application that allows educators to choose a text of a certain genre and reading level and assign it to groups of students. I was able to choose a text and go into the text to curate, as well as create, comprehension questions from the story. This allowed me to have students read independently at their reading level and answer comprehension questions on their own, which gave me information on what reading skills they had mastered at that level and where we needed to continue working. I was able to get those results back on the whole group at once, instead of determining that from multiple times of hearing students read. Each student used a Chromebook to access the website and complete the assignment. The benefits of this were that the students enjoyed the reading passages and questions. They were given instant feedback on their answers. It also provided me with instant data that I could use to further my instruction. One weakness of the project was that each student needed their own login and it took a lot of my time and attention to get them ready to do the assignment. If I worked with this app and did something like this again, I would probably choose to create an assignment for each small group and use the the application monthly to help me assess my students. The artifacts shown here are a video and pictures of the stories and quizzes that were created in Actively Learn as well as a description of how that data was in small group instruction.

                                <p class="b">
                                Another project that I was able to work on during my time as a Blended Learning Mentor for my school, was to use the website Epic! to curate a list of books about of social studies topic and then teach other staff members how to use the website. Epic! is a website that has a large variety of electronic books about a variety of subjects. Educators can create their own booklist with titles that will read aloud to students, contain quizzes to check knowledge, and create an interest in reading about the topic. To effectively use this application, each student utilized a Chromebook and headphones. The students really enjoyed having the option of which book they would like to read. Once I tried this application with my class, I shared with other colleagues about the features of the application. My colleagues were interested in the different benefits of Epic! and many were unfamiliar with it. I greatly appreciated being able to  bring new technology ideas back to other staff members. If I had to redo this project, I would specifically work with the different grade levels to brainstorm a good idea of a curated group of books on the app that would enhance the teachers’ instruction on a topic and help them incorporate it into their classrooms, instead of just bringing the idea. This artifact includes a picture the books that were curated.

                                <h3>Facilitator</h3>
                                <p class="c">This spring, COVID-19 caused my school district to move completely to an online platform, Canvas. We have used Canvas for a few years as a district, but lower grades do not use it frequently. This year, we had to quickly learn how to design our courses and communicate through the platform in order to help our students continue to learn and grow. To work with Canvas, every child needed a Chromebook and wifi. I was able to facilitate discussion, engagement and learning by using the Canvas platform, as well as help students to gain a better sense of what it means to be a digital citizen. This allowed students to be collaborators, digital citizens, and empowered learners (ISTE Standards for Students, 2020). What I did well was to format my course so that it was easy to navigate and find useful information. It I had to use this platform for distance learning again, I would encourage more collaboration and communication between students by utilizing more discussion boards and placing students into groups within the course to work on some kind of project. This would continue to help students meet the ISTE student standards as well. The artifact shown here is a picture of the main page that was created in my Canvas course.
